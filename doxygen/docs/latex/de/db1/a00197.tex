This Framework is an optional add-\/on to Unity. By including \mbox{\hyperlink{a00083}{unity\+\_\+fixture.\+h}} in place of \mbox{\hyperlink{a00125}{unity.\+h}}, you may now work with Unity in a manner similar to Cpp\+U\+Test. This framework adds the concepts of test groups and gives finer control of your tests over the command line.

This framework is primarily supplied for those working through James Grenning\textquotesingle{}s book on Embedded Test Driven Development, or those coming to Unity from Cpp\+U\+Test. We should note that using this framework glosses over some of the features of Unity, and makes it more difficult to integrate with other testing tools like Ceedling and C\+Mock.\hypertarget{a00197_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Dependency Notification}\label{a00197_autotoc_md4}
Fixtures, by default, uses the Memory addon as well. This is to make it simple for those trying to follow along with James\textquotesingle{} book. Using them together is completely optional. You may choose to use Fixtures without Memory handling by defining {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+Y\+\_\+\+F\+I\+X\+T\+U\+R\+E\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+R\+AS}. It will then stop automatically pulling in extras and leave you to do it as desired.\hypertarget{a00197_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Usage information}\label{a00197_autotoc_md5}
By default the test executables produced by Unity Fixtures run all tests once, but the behavior can be configured with command-\/line flags. Run the test executable with the {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} flag for more information.

It\textquotesingle{}s possible to add a custom line at the end of the help message, typically to point to project-\/specific or company-\/specific unit test documentation. Define {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+Y\+\_\+\+C\+U\+S\+T\+O\+M\+\_\+\+H\+E\+L\+P\+\_\+\+M\+SG} to provide a custom message, e.\+g.\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#define UNITY_CUSTOM_HELP_MSG "If any test fails see https://example.com/troubleshooting"
\end{DoxyVerb}
